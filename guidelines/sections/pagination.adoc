== Pagination

=== [.danger]#MUST# use pagination

Pagination is a common way to break up a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks.
We couldn't control how data grows, but we can control how we present it to the user.
We should never return all the data at once, as it can be overwhelming and slow down the client application.

We are using 3 type of page iteration techniques:

- *Offset-based pagination:*

- *Cursor-based pagination:*

- *Keyset-based pagination (seek method):*

==== Offset-based pagination

This technique involves using two parameters: "offset" and "limit." The "offset" parameter determines the starting point or position in the dataset, while the "limit" parameter specifies the maximum number of records to include on each page.

.Get the first 10 orders (offset: 0):
[source,httprequest]
----
GET /orders?offset=0&limit=10
----

.Get the next 10 orders (offset: 1):
[source,http]
----
GET /orders?offset=1&limit=10
----

==== Cursor-based pagination

Instead of relying on numeric offsets, cursor-based pagination uses a unique identifier or token to mark the position in the dataset.
The API consumer includes the cursor value in subsequent requests to fetch the next page of data.

This approach ensures stability when new data is added or existing data is modified.
The cursor can be based on various criteria, such as a timestamp, a primary key, or an encoded representation of the record.

.Get the first 10 orders:
[source,httprequest]
----
GET /orders?cursor=eyJpZCI6Mn0
----

==== Keyset-based pagination (seek method)

Keyset pagination, or the seek method, is tailored for scenarios that involve large or frequently-updated data sets.
It involves using a specific field (or set of fields) as a key to paginate through the data set.
This key is usually a unique and sequentially ordered columnâ€”for example, a timestamp or an auto-incrementing ID.


.Get 10 record after the order with ID 5:
[source,httprequest]
----
GET /orders?after_order_id=5&limit=10
----


.Get 15 record before the order with ID 50:
[source,httprequest]
----
GET /orders?before_order_id=50&limit=15
----


.Get 20 records updated after the timestamp:
[source,httprequest]
----

GET /orders?updated_after=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&limit=20
----


=== [.warning]#SHOULD# provide default values for pagination parameters

When designing a paginated API, it's a good practice to provide default values for the pagination parameters.

=== [.warning]#SHOULD# limit upper bound of the limit

Having no upper-bound limit could result with same performance issue if users sent limit with 10000 for example.
A max limit of 100 is considered a reasonable number.
