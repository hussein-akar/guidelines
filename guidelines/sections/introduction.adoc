== Introduction

Our services evolved into various microservices, with each team taking responsibility for their own APIs.
We've embraced an "API First" approach, meaning development begins with defining the API, which is then reviewed before any implementation begins.
By following this process, we ensure that all our APIs have a consistent look and feel, as if they were created by a single person.

In case guidelines are changing


=== Conventions used in these guidelines

[.danger]#*MUST*#: Indicates a requirement that must be followed.

[.warning]#*SHOULD*#: Indicates a recommendation that should be followed unless there is a good reason not to.

[.success]#*MAY*#: Indicates an optional suggestion that may be followed if deemed appropriate.

=== In case guidelines are changing

When guidelines are changing, we have to consider the following:

- Existing APIs donâ€™t have to be changed, but we recommend it
- New APIs have to respect the current guidelines
