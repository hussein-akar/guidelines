== General

=== [.danger]#MUST# follow API-first approach

We design the API using our link:https://gitlab.com/container-xchange/shared/apis[APIs] Project.
After creating the merge-request, the pipeline will automatically generate interfaces for both BE & FE that will be used for the implementation.

[.warning]#SHOULD# not start the implementation before the API is reviewed.

=== [.danger]#MUST# get approval before merging

Before merging the API, it must be reviewed by the team and get *at least* one approval.
